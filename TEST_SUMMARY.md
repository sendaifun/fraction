**What it does**:
- Creates a new splitter with 5 participants (20% share each initially)
- Initializes all participant balance PDAs
- Creates treasury account owned by splitter config PDA
- Verifies total shares sum to 10,000 BPS (100%)
- Confirms bot incentive is fixed at 200 BPS (2%)

**Key Validations**:
- Splitter config account created successfully
- All participant balance accounts initialized
- Treasury ATA created with correct authority
- Share distribution totals exactly 100%

### 2. Should update splitter configuration
**Purpose**: Tests the ability to modify participant shares and bot wallet after initialization.

**What it does**:
- Updates participant shares to: 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%
- Changes the bot wallet to a new keypair
- Verifies only the authority can perform updates
- Confirms bot incentive remains fixed at 2%

**Key Validations**:
- New participant shares are correctly stored
- Bot wallet is successfully updated
- Total shares still sum to 100%
- Authority-only access control working

### 3. Should deposit tokens
**Purpose**: Tests the token deposit functionality into the treasury.

**What it does**:
- Deposits 1,000,000 tokens (1 token with 6 decimals) into treasury
- Uses `transfer_checked` for secure token transfers
- Updates the `total_collected` field in splitter config
- Verifies treasury balance increases correctly

**Key Validations**:
- Tokens successfully transferred to treasury
- `total_collected` field updated accurately
- User's token balance decreased by deposit amount
- Treasury balance increased by deposit amount

### 4. Should claim and distribute
**Purpose**: Tests the core distribution mechanism triggered by the bot.

**What it does**:
- Makes an additional 2,000,000 token deposit (total: 3,000,000)
- Bot triggers distribution of all collected funds
- Bot receives exactly 2% (60,000 tokens)
- Remaining 98% (2,940,000 tokens) distributed to participants based on shares
- Resets `total_collected` to 0 after distribution

**Key Validations**:
- Bot receives exactly 2% of total collected
- Participants receive correct amounts based on their BPS shares
- All participant balance PDAs updated correctly
- Treasury balance reflects remaining funds
- `total_collected` reset to 0

### 5. Should withdraw participant shares
**Purpose**: Tests individual participant withdrawals from their balance accounts.

**What it does**:
- Participant 0 withdraws their allocated 882,000 tokens (30% of 2,940,000)
- Transfers tokens from treasury to participant's token account
- Resets participant balance PDA to 0
- Requires both participant and authority signatures

**Key Validations**:
- Participant receives exact allocated amount
- Participant balance PDA reset to 0
- Treasury balance decreased correctly
- Proper signature requirements enforced

## Security & Authorization Tests (4 tests)

### 6. Should reject initialization with invalid total shares
**Purpose**: Tests that the program rejects splitter creation when shares don't sum to 100%.

**What it does**:
- Attempts to create splitter with shares totaling 110% (invalid)
- Uses participants with 50%, 30%, 30% shares
- Expects transaction to fail due to validation

**Key Validations**:
- Transaction fails as expected
- Program enforces share validation rules
- Prevents creation of invalid splitter configurations

### 7. Should reject unauthorized update attempt
**Purpose**: Tests access control for splitter updates.

**What it does**:
- Unauthorized wallet attempts to update splitter configuration
- Uses wrong authority keypair for signing
- Expects transaction to fail with constraint violation

**Key Validations**:
- Only authorized wallet can update splitter
- Anchor's `has_one` constraint working correctly
- PDA seed validation prevents unauthorized access

### 8. Should reject claim from non-bot wallet
**Purpose**: Tests that only the configured bot wallet can trigger distribution.

**What it does**:
- Random wallet attempts to call `claim_and_distribute`
- Uses incorrect bot wallet for signing
- Expects transaction to fail with constraint violation

**Key Validations**:
- Only configured bot wallet can trigger distribution
- Bot wallet validation working correctly
- Prevents unauthorized fund distribution

### 9. Should reject withdrawal from wrong participant
**Purpose**: Tests that participants can only withdraw from their own balance accounts.

**What it does**:
- Random participant attempts to withdraw from wrong balance PDA
- Uses mismatched participant and balance account
- Expects transaction to fail with seed constraint violation

**Key Validations**:
- PDA seed validation prevents wrong participant access
- Participants can only access their own balance accounts
- Account relationship constraints working correctly

## Edge Cases & Robustness Tests (4 tests)

### 10. Should handle multiple deposits correctly
**Purpose**: Tests cumulative deposit tracking across multiple transactions.

**What it does**:
- Makes first deposit of 500,000 tokens
- Makes second deposit of 750,000 tokens
- Verifies `total_collected` accumulates correctly (1,250,000 + previous)

**Key Validations**:
- Multiple deposits are tracked cumulatively
- `total_collected` field updated correctly
- No overflow or calculation errors
- Treasury balance reflects all deposits

### 11. Should handle edge case with minimal deposit
**Purpose**: Tests the system with very small deposit amounts.

**What it does**:
- Deposits minimal amount (1 token unit)
- Verifies system handles small amounts correctly
- Confirms `total_collected` updated even for tiny deposits

**Key Validations**:
- System handles minimal deposits without errors
- No rounding or precision issues
- All tracking mechanisms work with small amounts

### 12. Should handle multiple withdrawals correctly
**Purpose**: Tests independent withdrawals by different participants.

**What it does**:
- Second participant (index 1) withdraws their share
- Verifies withdrawal independence between participants
- Confirms participant receives their 735,000 tokens (25% of 2,940,000)

**Key Validations**:
- Multiple participants can withdraw independently
- Each withdrawal is isolated and correct
- No interference between participant accounts
- Treasury balance updated correctly for each withdrawal

### 13. Should handle treasury balance updates correctly
**Purpose**: Tests treasury balance tracking accuracy.

**What it does**:
- Records initial treasury balance
- Makes 500,000 token deposit
- Verifies treasury balance increased by exact deposit amount

**Key Validations**:
- Treasury balance tracking is accurate
- No discrepancies between expected and actual balances
- System maintains precise accounting

## Business Logic & Lifecycle Tests (2 tests)

### 14. Should verify bot incentive remains fixed at 2%
**Purpose**: Tests that the bot always receives exactly 2% regardless of deposit amounts.

**What it does**:
- Makes 1,000,000 token deposit
- Triggers distribution
- Verifies bot receives at least the expected 2% (20,000 tokens)
- Accounts for bot's existing balance from previous distributions

**Key Validations**:
- Bot incentive calculation is correct
- Fixed 2% rate is maintained
- Bot receives appropriate amount regardless of total

### 15. Should complete full lifecycle test
**Purpose**: Tests the complete end-to-end flow of the system.

**What it does**:
- Verifies current system state
- Makes final deposit of 1,000,000 tokens
- Triggers complete distribution
- Confirms final state is correct
- Validates entire system workflow

**Key Validations**:
- Complete system lifecycle works correctly
- All components integrate properly
- Final state matches expectations
- System ready for production use
