![Fraction Protocol Overview](./docs/images/img.png)

*built for agents & apps*

</div>

### How It Works

- You create a `fraction_config` which defines how funds should flow
- Anyone can send money to this `fraction_config` address
- A cranker, checks and intiates `claim` transaction which distributes all funds present according to the intial config defined.

**[View SDK Documentation â†’](./sdk/README.md)**

## Distribution Mechanics

When the authorized agent executes distribution:
- Agent receives 0.05% as protocol fee
- Participants receive split according to configured percentages
- All transfers occur atomically in single transaction
- Treasury is emptied completely
- No manual withdrawal steps required
